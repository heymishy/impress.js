impress.js
============

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.

**WARNING**

impress.js may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)


ABOUT THE NAME
----------------

impress.js name in [courtesy of @skuzniak](http://twitter.com/skuzniak/status/143627215165333504).

It's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)
